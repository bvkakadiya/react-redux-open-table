1) I have spend about 4 hours to complete the coding test. If I had more time I would like complete validation unit test and more functionality.

2) For every component I have used Function component and Hooks which you can see on different component;

3) I would find the issue by debugging, And Create Profile for page then analyze that page using dev tools

4) I would improve the API that i used in my test by making sure all the data is showing correctly if not redirect the user to the choose another restaurant. For example: Some of the URL links to the open table app were throwing error.
